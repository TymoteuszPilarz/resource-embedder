Cmake script designed to embed any resource file into the executable at compile time.

# USAGE:
1) Use "set(EMBEDDED_RESOURCES <file_path1> [: <variable_name1>]
                               <file_path2> [: <variable_name2>]
                               ...)" in your main CMakeList.txt
2) Link the library generated by this script with
"target_link_libraries(<target> <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> ResourceEmbedder)" in your main CMakeList.txt
3) Include "resource_embedder.h" in any file you would like to use preloaded resources in
4) Now you can use the resources with "embedder::example_variable"

# NOTES:
- Variable names are optional, if you don't specify any name, it will be set to "filename_extension"
- If the name of the variable is already in use, it will be set to "variable_name1", "variable_name2", etc.
- The working directory is set to the parent's directory which invokes "add_subdirectory()", but absolute paths
  will work as well
