# Resource Embedder

Cmake script designed to embed any resource file into the executable at compile time.
It will automatically generate necessary header and source files, which then you can use in the manner demonstrated below.

# USAGE:
1) Use "set(EMBEDDED_RESOURCES<br> <file_path1> [: <variable_name1>]<br>
                               [<file_path2> [: <variable_name2>]<br>
                               ...])" in your main CMakeList.txt
2) Link the library generated by this script with
"target_link_libraries(<target> <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> ResourceEmbedder)" in your main CMakeList.txt
3) Include "resource_embedder.h" in any file you would like to use preloaded resources in
4) Now you can use the resources with "embedder::example_variable"

# NOTES:
- Variable names are optional, if you don't specify any name, it will be set to "filename_extension"
- If the name of the variable is already in use (e.g., "variable_name"), it will be set to "variable_name1", "variable_name2", etc.
- The working directory is set to the parent's directory which invokes "add_subdirectory()", but absolute paths
  will work as well
